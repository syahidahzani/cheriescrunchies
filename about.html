  <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
  <p style="line-height:2.0; font-size: 20px; ">In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, our beautiful silk items are hand-cut and hand-sewn. This is the greatest beauty secret for your hair, made of 100% silk. We decided to manufacture eco-friendly scrunchies to address the hole left by women's inability to combine fashion with comfort. The vast majority of accessories on the market today are of poor quality and serve largely to improve a person's visual appeal at the expense of usefulness. They are all handcrafted and we have a dedicated team that takes great care in making them, especially for our babes out there!</p>

  <h1>OUR MATERIAL</h1>
  <p style="line-height:2.0; font-size: 20px; ">We believe in making the greatest products possible by procuring all of our silk satin fabric, textiles, packaging and materials from our suppliers like Jakel Mall and Gulati's Silk House and our silk thread is from gutermann brand. We specialise in sustainability, which is why none of our fabric is wasted and we endeavour to offer more sustainable eco-friendly packaging solutions for our products. All of our scrunchies were made in satin because it is our favourite fabrics to work with, not to mention how nice it feels. Satin refers to the weave and the cloth. It is commonly described as having a velvety, lustrous finish that is ideal for keeping your hair strong, healthy and free of split ends for our babes out there!</p>
